We are trying to find the predictors for the ratio of dollar to pound. As team we had first decided on a different topic "Will I live longer if I cycle to work?" . But in the process of trying to collect data we found that there was a lot of scientific studies associated with the topic but no real proof. We could not find out any scientific formula that directly links the factors we were considering(amount of oxygen intake, pollution,BMI etc)to the increase in life expectancy.So even after spending almost 4 weeks in trying to collect data we had to shift our focus to some other topic where at least we could get a significantly high volume of data.Thus we shifted our focus to an economic topic trying to predict the top three indicators affecting the currency of that country.We have taken into account several factors.They are exchange rates,interest rates,employment,population,tradenetworks,GDP and inflation. We are taking the G-20 countries into account.Out of the factors some are annual ,like the employment,population,tradenetworks,GDP and inflation. For these we have taken the time range of 1991-2016. The rest are interest rates and exchange rates which are more frequent.The data for these are taken for a wider range of time.
